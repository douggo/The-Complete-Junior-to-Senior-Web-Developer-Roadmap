Exercise: #1 - Media Queries

In the last lecture and the upcoming ones, I will be using the simple website to demonstrate some points. If you would like to follow along with the code, or you want to experiment yourself, I have attached the files here. Go ahead and experiment with the Media Queries to get comfortable with the technique! Important: These files will be used in the upcoming Exercise #2, so only worry about playing around Media Queries for now as we will be coming back to making this little project more optimized. 

Additionally, here are some extra resources:
